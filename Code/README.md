# Instructions for Running the Model
You can run the model once by running bvm_model.py. The model itself is initialized with certain parameters that are labeled. 

To run a parameter suite/sweep, you can run runFile.py. Before running runFile.py, comment out the data collection in bvm_model.py to greatly reduce the runtime of the parameter suite/sweep.
