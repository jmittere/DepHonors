	abstract = {Evolution of altruistic behaviour in interacting individuals is accounted for by, for example, kin selection, direct reciprocity, spatially limited interaction and indirect reciprocity. Real social agents, particularly humans, often take actions based on similarity between themselves and others. Although tag-based indirect reciprocity in which altruism occurs exclusively among similar flocks is a natural expectation, its mechanism has not really been established. We propose a model of tag-based indirect reciprocity by assuming that each player may note strategies of others. We show that tag-based altruism can evolve to eradicate other strategies, including unconditional defectors for various initial strategy configurations and parameter sets. A prerequisite for altruism is that the strategy is sometimes, but not always, visible to others. Without visibility of strategies, policing does not take place and defection is optimal. With perfect visibility, what a player does is always witnessed by others and cooperation is optimal. In the intermediate regime, discriminators based on tag proximity, rather than mixture of generous players and defectors, are most likely to evolve. In this situation, altruism is realized based on homophily in which players are exclusively good to similar others.},

	abstract = {This research investigates the extent to which the personality trait of Openness-to-Experience can protect individuals from living in personal echo chambers that create and reinforce a narrow view on the world. Analyses of 2 large-scale data sets with over 80,000 participants and more than 40,000,000 behavioral observations demonstrate that individuals scoring high on Openness show higher variability in the psychological profiles associated with their personal interests—a novel concept termed psychological interest diversity. Study 1 examines the Facebook profiles of 57,185 users to demonstrate that a person’s Openness level predicts the degree to which the pages they like are diverse in the political ideologies, personal values, and personality traits of their followers. Study 2 replicates the findings of Study 1 using over 28,000,000 GPS-tracked event attendances collected via people’s smartphones. Specifically, the results show that individuals (N = 22,953) with higher levels of Openness also show higher levels of psychological interest diversity in the events they attend, and that this effect is incremental to county-level variation in psychological interest diversity. The findings empirically support the theoretical conceptualization of Openness as a preference for variety and exploration and corroborate the role of personal dispositions in the creation of personal echo chambers. The discussion highlights the need to further explore psychological interest diversity as the initial basis of algorithmic filter bubbles—for example, recommendation systems or targeted advertising—which further amplify and reinforce existing interests and preferences.

We find that the emergence of pernicious polarization (when a society is split into mutually distrustful “Us vs. Them” camps) is not attributable to any specific underlying social or political cleavage nor any particular institutional make-up. Instead, pernicious polarization arises when political entrepreneurs pursue their political objectives by using polarizing strategies, such as mobilizing voters with divisive, demonizing discourse and exploiting existing grievances, and opposing political elites then reciprocate with similarly polarizing tactics or fail to develop effective nonpolarizing responses. We explain how the political construction of polarization around “formative rifts” (social or political rifts that arise during the fundamental formation/reformation of a nation-state), the relative capacity of opposing political blocs to mobilize voters versus relying on mechanisms such as courts or the military to constrain the executive, and the strategic and ideological aims of the polarizing actors contribute to the emergence of its pernicious form. We analyze the consequences for democracy and conclude with reflections on how to combat pernicious polarization.},

	abstract = {This New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestseller shows us that America’s political system isn’t broken. The truth is scarier: it’s working exactly as designed. In this “superbly researched” (The Washington Post) and timely book, journalist Ezra Klein reveals how that system is polarizing us—and how we are polarizing it—with disastrous results. “The American political system—which includes everyone from voters to journalists to the president—is full of rational actors making rational decisions given the incentives they face,” writes political analyst Ezra Klein. “We are a collection of functional parts whose efforts combine into a dysfunctional whole.” “A thoughtful, clear and persuasive analysis” (The New York Times Book Review), Why We’re Polarized reveals the structural and psychological forces behind America’s descent into division and dysfunction. Neither a polemic nor a lament, this book offers a clear framework for understanding everything from Trump’s rise to the Democratic Party’s leftward shift to the politicization of everyday culture. America is polarized, first and foremost, by identity. Everyone engaged in American politics is engaged, at some level, in identity politics. Over the past fifty years in America, our partisan identities have merged with our racial, religious, geographic, ideological, and cultural identities. These merged identities have attained a weight that is breaking much in our politics and tearing at the bonds that hold this country together. Klein shows how and why American politics polarized around identity in the 20th century, and what that polarization did to the way we see the world and one another. And he traces the feedback loops between polarized political identities and polarized political institutions that are driving our system toward crisis. “Well worth reading” (New York magazine), this is an “eye-opening” (O, The Oprah Magazine) book that will change how you look at politics—and perhaps at yourself.},

Human beings are quick to join a group, add it as part of their identity, and then hate rival groups. We'd even rather all groups do poorly as long as our rival group does worse than us.
Group identity generally matters more to us than policy.
"Cognition exists on a spectrum, ranging from issues where the truth matters and our identities don't to issues where our identities dominate and the truth fades in importance."
"Much of what the media thought were interests were actually identities...You feed an interest with information; you build an identity through socialization."
"identities...[are]...living, malleable things. They can be activated or left dormant, strengthened or weakened, created or left in the void."
"An identity, once adopted, is harder to change than an opinion. An identity that binds you into a community you care about is costly and painful to abandon..."
 
 
Backfiring:
"...exposure to popular, authoritative voices from the other side of aisle [resulted in] an increase in issue-based polarization.... hearing contrary opinions drove partisans not just to a deeper certainty in the rightness of their cause, but more polarized policy positions..."
"There is evidence that structuring positive, collaborative interactions can promote understanding. But very little in either political media or social media is designed for positive interactions with the other side."
 
 
Sorting:
"The political parties used to be scrambled, both ideologically and demographically, in ways that curbed their power as identities." But they've now moved to an era of sorting, which reinforces partisanship.
The sorting is both ideological and demographic, which fuses many different powerful identities together. This makes partisanship more likely to kick in, since activating one identity tends to activate all of them.
 
Interested/uninterested:
The key factor in democracies used to be access to political information. In the Internet age, it's now interest in political information.
What makes people interested in political news? It's that they are rooting for a side, for a set of outcomes.
 
Media:
"A polarized media environment can polarize the country through its effect on political elites and party activists."
"Politics is, first and foremost, driven by the people who pay the most attention and wield the most power -- and those people opt in to extraordinarily politicized media. They then create the political system they perceive. The rest of the country then has to choose from more polarized options, and that in turn polarizes them..."

"...a more polarized electorate changes the strategies candidates use to get elected. Those more polarized strategies further polarize the electorate. and then the cycle continues."},

	abstract = {Analysts and pundits increasingly perceive a widening gulf between "red states" and "blue states." Yet the research to support that perception is scattered and sometimes difficult to parse. America's polarized politics, it is said, poses fundamental dangers for democratic and accountable government. Heightened partisanship is thought to degrade deliberation in Congress and threaten the integrity of other institutions, from the courts to the media. But, how deep do the country's political divisions actually run? Are they truly wreaking havoc upon the social fabric? Has America become a house divided? This important new book, Red and Blue Nation?, gets to the bottom of this perplexing issue. The first of two volumes cosponsored by Brookings and the Hoover Institution carefully considers the extent to which polarized views among political leaders and activists are reflected in the population at large. It pays particular attention to factors such as the increased influence of religion and the changing nature of the media. The authors show that while the severity of the country's "culture wars" is often overstated, significant fissures have opened. In Red and Blue Nation? leading journalists and scholars combine their different insights to enrich our understanding of the issue, offering thoughtful analyses of the underlying problems. This comprehensive and accessible discussion of the polarization debate will be an essential resource for policymakers, scholars, and anyone interested in the health of American public discourse.

"The U.S. Congress is more polarized ideologically than it was just a generation ago. In the House of Representatives, ideological overlap between the political parties has all but disappeared, and the rise of "safe" districts with partisan supermajorities has tended to push representatives away from the center" (Nivola and Brady 2006:1)
"the repeal of the fairness doctrine" (Nivola and Brady 2006:2)
"While there is no evidence that the electorate's overall ideological balance has changed much over the past three decades, voters are being sorted: fewer selfidentified Democrats or liberals vote for Republican candidates than they did in the 1970s" (Nivola and Brady 2006:2)
"The unsettled questions are how far these trends go and how much difference they ultimately make. Do substantial segments of the mass electorate, not just political elites, tend to cluster consistently into opposing ideological camps that differentiate the respective agendas and candidates of the political parties?" (Nivola and Brady 2006:2)
"polarized politics are one thing, close division or partisan parity quite another." (Nivola and Brady 2006:3)
"The conventional wisdom is that the electorate has been both deeply and closely divided during most of the national elections of the past decade. We argue that this proposition is valid to an extent." (Nivola and Brady 2006:3)
"Its proponents often go on to claim, however, that the interaction between deep and close division is bound to create inertia." (Nivola and Brady 2006:3)
""polarization" is not synonymous with "culture war."" (Nivola and Brady 2006:3)
"most Americans have remained centrists, sharing a mixture of liberal and conservative views on a variety of presumably divisive social questions. Ideologues of the left or right—that is, persons with a Weltanschauung,or whose politics consistently form an overarching world view that tilts to extremes—are conspicuous on the fringes of the two parties and among political elites, but scarcely among the public at large." (Nivola and Brady 2006:8)
"how substantial are the portions of" (Nivola and Brady 2006:9)
"the electorate that heed their opinion leaders, and thus might be hardening their political positions? Here, as best we can tell, the tectonic plates of the nation's electoral politics appear to be shifting more than Fiorina and his coauthors were willing to concede." (Nivola and Brady 2006:10)
"the attributes of the Democratic and Republican identifiers have changed. They are considerably more cohesive ideologically than just a few decades ago" (Nivola and Brady 2006:10)
"as their outlooks tracked party loyalties more closely, Democratic and Republican voters became far less likely to desert their party's candidates" (Nivola and Brady 2006:10)
"the distance between their respective sets of convictions." (Nivola and Brady 2006:11)
"migrate geographically" (Nivola and Brady 2006:12)
"if voters tend to migrate geographically toward like-minded voters, the resulting political segregation of Democrats and Republicans could increasingly lock in their differences: a person's partisan inclinations seem more likely to deepen and endure if he or she is spatially surrounded by fellow partisans." (Nivola and Brady 2006:12)
"what are the effects of elite polarization on the mass electorate" (Nivola and Brady 2006:16)
"One possibility raised by Fiorina and others is that the people as a whole are not shifting their ideological or policy preferences much. Rather, they are being presented with increasingly polarized choices, which force voters to change their political behavior" (Nivola and Brady 2006:16)
"Another possibility is that changes at the elite level have communicated new information about parties, ideology, and policies to many voters, leading to changes of attitudes and preferences that will be hard to reverse, even in less polarized circumstances" (Nivola and Brady 2006:17)
"there is evidence suggesting that as party hierarchies, members of Congress, media outlets, and advocacy groups polarize, so gradually does much of the public. Voters become more aware of the differences between the parties, they are better able to locate themselves in relation to the parties, and they care more about the outcome of elections. As a result, their partisan preferences become better aligned with their ideological and policy preferences." (Nivola and Brady 2006:17)
"Voters (especially the attentive ones) exposed to the drumbeat of partisan and ideological disputes among opinion leaders eventually pick up their messages" (Nivola and Brady 2006:17)
"voters who have positioned themselves clearly on an issue, care intensely about it, and see important differences between the parties over it choose sides accordingly. For other voters who care less about a given issue, party identification is the primary driver: When their party changes its position, they tend to change as well." (Nivola and Brady 2006:18)
"elite polarization has another dimension—namely, its effects on young adults entering the electorate without fully formed preferences and attachments." (Nivola and Brady 2006:18)
"the increasingly polarized parties and their activists tend to polarize young adults whose attitudes, once formed, are likely to remain stable over a lifetime." (Nivola and Brady 2006:18)
"In 1972, the year before Roe, neither party's platform even mentioned abortion. In 1976 both parties held moderate (and nearly interchangeable) positions. Over the next two presidential cycles, however, activists in the two parties moved farther away from one another, and by 1984 the party platforms had settled into the polarized paradigms that have persisted over the past two decades" (Nivola and Brady 2006:20)
"The end of the cold war ushered in what one of us has called "the age of low politics."62 Relieved of the need to pull together in the face of a great external threat, the political parties now could afford to pull apart—and to wrangle about every manner of domestic issue" (Nivola and Brady 2006:21)
"Religious observance and political preference now are powerfully correlated" (Nivola and Brady 2006:22)
"Competitive districts are vanishing." (Nivola and Brady 2006:24)
"a profusion of one-party districts drives moderates out of Congress." (Nivola and Brady 2006:25)
"The imperative instead becomes to appeal to the base and preempt possible primary challenges from the extremes." (Nivola and Brady 2006:25)
"Increased polarization of the political parties carries at least four risks." (Nivola and Brady 2006:35)
"In these respects" (Nivola and Brady 2006:40)},

"an exhaustive analysis of General Social Survey and National Election Studies data from the years 1972 to 1994 and found that the political views of Americans had become more similar, not more different." (Nivola and Brady 2006:3)
"People who are active in politics know a lot and care a lot about politics and public policy, and their views are organized according to ideological frameworks. In contrast, most ordinary voters have less knowledge about politics, care less about it, and are largely nonideological." (Nivola and Brady 2006:4)
"people who are active in politics tend to have more extreme views than ordinary voters" (Nivola and Brady 2006:4)
"polarization implies that the political opinions and attitudes of the public—in the aggregate—have been pushed away from moderate, centrist positions to the liberal or conservative extreme." (Nivola and Brady 2006:5)
"Instead, over the past generation, party sorting—the process by which a tighter fit is brought about between political ideology and party affiliation—has occurred in American politics." (Nivola and Brady 2006:5)
"We prefer the term "party sorting," reserving the term polarization for bimodal distributions of opinion, or movements toward a bimodal distribution of opinion: voters are polarized on an issue if more of them cluster at the extremes than locate themselves in the center, or if they are moving from centrist positions toward the extremes." (Nivola and Brady 2006:6)
"This much of the story thus sits on solid evidence: as elites became more ideologically distinctive over the past quarter-century, ordinary voters recognized this development and then changed their positions, bringing their party identification and ideology more into alignment with each other.19" (Nivola and Brady 2006:9)
"the pattern among ordinary voters is much weaker than among political elites:" (Nivola and Brady 2006:9)
"nearly as ideologically divided as" (Nivola and Brady 2006:9)
"the simple fact is that people exhibit liberal positions on some issues and conservative positions on others." (Nivola and Brady 2006:10)
"The party attachments of ordinary Americans have become more closely associated with their ideological self-classifications and with their positions on some issues" (Nivola and Brady 2006:21)
"But the same data also show that the increase in sorting over the three decades has been modest, contrary to what is often asserted." (Nivola and Brady 2006:21)
"primaries are a more likely arena in which to find explanations of political polarization" (Nivola and Brady 2006:22)
"If members anticipate potential challenges from the ideological poles, they will act preemptively to diminish the chances of that occurring. As sorting occurs, more and more candidates find themselves in such circumstances. Because sorting produces a more homogeneous and a more extreme primary electorate, the pressure increases for candidates to take consistently liberal or conservative positions on most issues, even when moderation would be more helpful in the general election. Thus sorted partisans move candidates toward noncentrist positions.43 And" (Nivola and Brady 2006:23)
"There is evidence that the American public has become more polarized in its political views over the past twenty years. And while polarization is indeed greatest among the most politically engaged citizens, these engaged citizens are not, as Fiorina and Levendusky claim, a small and unrepresentative fringe group." (Nivola and Brady 2006:25)
"sorting is not a process separate from polarization—it is a major contributor to polarization" (Nivola and Brady 2006:25)
"the American public is far from homogeneous when it comes to political interest, knowledge, and activity." (Nivola and Brady 2006:25)
"Active citizens are defined as those who engaged in at least one activity beyond voting while campaign activists are defined as those who engaged in at least two activities beyond voting." (Nivola and Brady 2006:26)
"Entries are standard deviations of scores" (Nivola and Brady 2006:28)
"Fiorina and Levendusky's characterization of the American public as nonideological actually appears to apply to only one of these four groups—nonvoters." (Nivola and Brady 2006:29)
"Far from being disconnected from the public, Democratic and Republican candidates and officeholders are polarized precisely because they are highly responsive to their parties' electoral bases" (Nivola and Brady 2006:32)
"characterization of the typical American voter as disinterested, uninformed, and nonideological might have been accurate during the 1950s era" (Nivola and Brady 2006:36)
"But it is not an accurate description of the American electorate in the first decade of the twenty-first century." (Nivola and Brady 2006:36)
"the American electorate today is far better educated than the public of the 1950s." (Nivola and Brady 2006:36)
"9 Democrats have tended to place themselves slightly to the right of their party, and Republicans slightly to the left of theirs" (Nivola and Brady 2006:39)
"What has changed is the gap between partisans' self-placements and the perceived locations of the rival party, which has grown by a full point on the scale for both Republican and Democratic voters." (Nivola and Brady 2006:40)
"sorting may have strengthened partisan sentiments, for either that or some other process is required to explain increasingly divergent partisan responses to national politicians and issues" (Nivola and Brady 2006:42)
"Partisan sorting has not only produced more ideologically coherent rival electoral coalitions; it has evidently left a large proportion of ordinary citizens primed to respond in partisan terms at the slightest provocation." (Nivola and Brady 2006:42)
"It is these regular manifestations of partisan division—along with recordhigh levels of party-line voting in recent elections—that make it hard to believe that mass partisan polarization is illusory or that partisan polarization is limited to a narrow segment of the electorate." (Nivola and Brady 2006:44)
"the distance between Democratic and Republican voters on these issues has been growing. Democratic voters have been moving to the left while Republican voters have been moving to the right. By referring to this trend as "sorting," Fiorina and Levendusky appear to be downplaying its significance. However, the fact that the electoral base of the Democratic Party has become more liberal while the electoral base of the Republican Party has become more conservative is one of the most significant developments in American politics of the past thirty years."

"six social upheavals: the civil rights, antiwar, women's rights, and anti-tax movements; the sexual revolution; and the rise of religious conservatism" (Nivola and Brady 2006:8)
""Throughout the electorate, there has been a fundamental change in the relationship between partisanship and social/cultural ideology. A generation ago, for most members of the mass electorate, party identification and social values were only weakly related. Now, for a sizable portion of the U.S. electorate, party and these kinds of ideologies are deeply intertwined," political scientist Matthew S. Levendusky has demonstrated. In addition, he says, "The national parties have drifted further from one another over the past thirty years, and became more ideologically distinct, which means that the parties now send a more unified and homogenous ideological signal. As voters see this purer signal from each party, they can more easily see what policy positions make someone a Democrat or a Republican. The parties come to function as political 'brand names" (Nivola and Brady 2006:8)
"voters are increasingly evaluating issues and debates by looking through Republican or Democratic lenses" (Nivola and Brady 2006:8)

The basic idea of SJT is that individual opinion changing is a judgmental process: if an agent considers that a presented opinion is close to its current opinion, then it is likely to shift in the direction of this opinion (assimilation); if it considers that the presented opinion is distant to its current opinion, then it is likely to shift away from this opinion (contrast); otherwise, the agent does not change its opinion (non-commitment). This general idea has led to different formal models [1, 5, 8] in which the thresholds agents use to characterize what are close and distant opinions are identical or not, universal or agent dependent. Some other works, like [11], are based on the theory of motivated cognition, defined in Cognitive Psychology, and which also says that agents are skeptical of another agent when their opinions diverge, but are more receptive to persuasion when their opinions better align. Some other works in the field of diffusion in multi agent systems claim to be based on models provided by the Network Science community. For instance, [2] is based on the SIR model which says that the value of an agent’s feature evolves according to the values of its neighbors feature values. For instance an agent is infected if one of its neighbor is. Or an agent may say that it believes something if its neighbors said that they also do."

For opinion-dependent neighborhoods, we show that the Hegselmann-Krause model converges to a stable state if each agent’s neighborhood is restricted either to a subset of her acquaintances or to a small random subset of agents.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Why do populations often self-organize into antagonistic groups even in the absence of competition,over scarce resources? Is there a tendency to demarcate groups of “us” and “them” that is inscribed in our cognitive architecture? We look for answers by exploring the dynamics,of influence and attraction between computational agents. Our model is an extension of Hopfield’s attractor network. Agents are attracted to others with similar states (the principle of homophily) and are also influenced by others, as conditioned by the strength and valence of the social tie. Negative valence implies xenophobia,(instead of homophily) and differentiation (instead of imitation). Consistent with earlier work on structural balance, we find that networks can self- organize into two antagonistic factions, without the knowledge or intent of the agents. We model this tendency as a function of network size, the number of potentially contentious issues, and agents' openness and flexibility toward alternative positions. Although we find that polarization into two antagonistic groups is a unique global attractor, we investigate the conditions under which uniform and pluralistic alignments may also be equilibria. From a random start, agents can self-organize into pluralistic arrangements,if the population size is large relative to the size of the state space. 2},

-Sounds like combination of models 1, 2, and 3.... physical distance based influence + opinion distance based influence
 
Extensions:
1. "experiments for the other kinds of extreme opinions are to made in the near future"
2. Majority-Based Merging Operator instead of Importance-Based Merging
3. Add dynamic aspect by changing the relations of influence through time
-rank-based models, ranking of influencers could change as the opinions change through time (compute new influence 'rankings')},

The species are fairly matched and the result of conflict is the invasion by one of the species of territory held by the other. A simple stochastic model for this process is described and rules are given for the calculation, as a function of time, of the probabilities that individual territories and groups of territories are held by a single species. Asymptotic results are given for the pattern of territories held by a single species, and here a remarkable distinction is seen between the cases of one-dimensional and two-dimensional competition and the case of three-dimensional competition. The process of invasion is contrasted with two relatively benign processes, that in which an exchange of territories is arranged and that in which a spatial alternation of species may be beneficial to the community. The implications of the long-term behaviour of such processes are discussed. It is suggested further that, under certain ideal conditions, it may be possible to estimate the duration of a spatial struggle for life by observing at some time the configuration of territories held by each species.},

	abstract = {Opinion dynamics concerns social processes through which populations or groups of individuals agree or disagree on specific issues. As such, modelling opinion dynamics represents an important research area that has been progressively acquiring relevance in many different domains. Existing approaches have mostly represented opinions through discrete binary or continuous variables by exploring a whole panoply of cases: e.g. independence, noise, external effects, multiple issues. In most of these cases the crucial ingredient is an attractive dynamics through which similar or similar enough agents get closer. Only rarely the possibility of explicit disagreement has been taken into account (i.e., the possibility for a repulsive interaction among individuals' opinions), and mostly for discrete or 1-dimensional opinions, through the introduction of additional model parameters. Here we introduce a new model of opinion formation, which focuses on the interplay between the possibility of explicit disagreement, modulated in a self-consistent way by the existing opinions' overlaps between the interacting individuals, and the effect of external information on the system. Opinions are modelled as a vector of continuous variables related to multiple possible choices for an issue. Information can be modulated to account for promoting multiple possible choices. Numerical results show that extreme information results in segregation and has a limited effect on the population, while milder messages have better success and a cohesion effect. Additionally, the initial condition plays an important role, with the population forming one or multiple clusters based on the initial average similarity between individuals, with a transition point depending on the number of opinion choices.},

However, there is no standard protocol for describing such simulation models, which can make them difficult to understand and to duplicate. This paper presents a proposed standard protocol, ODD, for describing IBMs and ABMs, developed and tested by 28 modellers who cover a wide range of fields within ecology. This protocol consists of three blocks (Overview, Design concepts, and Details), which are subdivided into seven elements: Purpose, State variables and scales, Process overview and scheduling, Design concepts, Initialization, Input, and Submodels. We explain which aspects of a model should be described in each element, and we present an example to illustrate the protocol in use. In addition, 19 examples are available in an Online Appendix. We consider ODD as a first step for establishing a more detailed common format of the description of IBMs and ABMs. Once initiated, the protocol will hopefully evolve as it becomes used by a sufficiently large proportion of modellers.},

	abstract = {The process by which new ideas, innovations, and behaviors spread through a large social network can be thought of as a networked interaction game: Each agent obtains information from certain number of agents in his friendship neighborhood, and adapts his idea or behavior to increase his benefit. In this paper, we are interested in how opinions, about a certain topic, form in social networks. We model opinions as continuous scalars ranging from 0 to 1 with 1(0) representing extremely positive(negative) opinion. Each agent has an initial opinion and incurs some cost depending on the opinions of his neighbors, his initial opinion, and his stubbornness about his initial opinion. Agents iteratively update their opinions based on their own initial opinions and observing the opinions of their neighbors. The iterative update of an agent can be viewed as a myopic cost-minimization response (i.e., the so-called best response) to the others' actions. We study whether an equilibrium can emerge as a result of such local interactions and how such equilibrium possibly depends on the network structure, initial opinions of the agents, and the location of stubborn agents and the extent of their stubbornness. We also study the convergence speed to such equilibrium and characterize the convergence time as a function of aforementioned factors. We also discuss the implications of such results in a few well-known graphs such as Erdos-Renyi random graphs and small-world graphs.},
